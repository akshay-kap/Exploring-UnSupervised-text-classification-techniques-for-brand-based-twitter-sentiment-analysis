### This folder contains the notebook for various models trained on Sentiment140.
### Word2vec, TF-IDF, doc2vec and SBERT bases preprocessing models have been used for KSOM based unsupervised implementations. (Training done on sampled 50k data)
### Word2vec based multiple LSTM and Conv1d models were trained on sentiment140.
### BERT based supevised models were also trained on sentiment140.

The performance of all these methods can be seen from here
