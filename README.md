# Exploring-unsupervised-text-classification-technique-and-brand-based-twitter-sentiment-analysis
Exploring KSOM model with word2vec, doc2vec and SBERT models, comparison were performed with LSTMs (bidirectional and unidirectional), conv1d, Supervised BERT models
- The polarity of associated sentiments was visualized by Tableau dashboards <br>

- __Read Project_Report.pdf for comprehensive understanding of dataset used, data preprocessing, data modelling, experimented techniques, and the data visualization obtained.__
- A typical sentiment plarity plot obtained by training Kohononn's self organizing map using SBERT model looks like this :
